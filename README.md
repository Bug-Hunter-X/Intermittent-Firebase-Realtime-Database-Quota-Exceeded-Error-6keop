# Intermittent Firebase Realtime Database Quota Exceeded Error

This repository demonstrates a recurring issue where Firebase Realtime Database throws a "Quota exceeded" error even when the project's usage is significantly below the free tier limits. The error occurs intermittently and without a clear pattern, making it difficult to identify the root cause and implement a reliable solution.

The `quotaError.js` file contains code that simulates the scenario leading to the error.  `quotaSolution.js` offers potential solutions and workarounds.
