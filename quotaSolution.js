To mitigate the intermittent "Quota exceeded" errors, consider these strategies:

1. **Optimize Data Structure:** Ensure your Realtime Database data structure is efficient.  Avoid unnecessary data duplication and deeply nested structures.  Use appropriate indexes to speed up queries.
2. **Implement Rate Limiting:** Introduce client-side rate limiting to control the frequency of database operations. This prevents sudden bursts of activity from exceeding quotas.
3. **Monitor Database Usage:**  Closely monitor your Firebase project's usage through the Firebase console to identify any unusual spikes in read or write operations.  This allows for proactive adjustments.
4. **Data Deduplication:** If you are storing redundant data, remove it. It leads to increase in data size which will increase the cost.
5. **Review Rules:** Ensure that your Firebase security rules are not overly permissive, leading to unauthorized access or unnecessary data retrieval.  Optimize rules for efficiency.

The `quotaSolution.js` file demonstrates these techniques.
